# EcoVision: AI-Driven Conservation Projects

A curated collection of computer-vision pipelines solving real-world conservation challenges. Each folder represents an end-to-end workflow—from data ingestion and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and deployment—developed in RPI’s *AI for Conservation* course.

| Project Folder                | Focus Area                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `wildlife-classifier`         | Multi-species classification on camera-trap data |
| `megadetector`    | Automatic blank-frame detection & filtering      |
| `invasive-spread-predictor`   | Classification and Spatio-temporal modeling of invasive insect species     |
