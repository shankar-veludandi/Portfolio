# EcoVision: AI-Driven Conservation Projects

A curated collection of computer-vision pipelines solving real-world conservation challenges. Each folder represents an end-to-end workflow—from data ingestion and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and deployment—developed in RPI’s *AI for Conservation* course.
